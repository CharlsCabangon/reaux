# REAUX

---
*A framework for fine design... [visit Reaux]()*

---

Reaux is an e-commerce mock project built for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), designed as a playground to test my React skills. It’s a jewelry store concept offering elegant pieces (data graciously borrowed from [Swarovski](https://www.swarovski.com/)) wrapped in a sleek, modern UI.

This project was my first real dance with Tailwind CSS, plus a practical run with React Router, Context, Reducer, Refs, Memoization, and Vitest for testing. Basically, it’s where I tried to make React behave like fine jewelry—structured, polished, and a little extra.
